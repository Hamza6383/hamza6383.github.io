                            <p class="indivisual-descriptions paragraph1">I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of planning applications in my 2 years of working as a proffesional in the industry. These applications have been for both residential and commercial projects. Each application has required me to work closely with clients to understand their vision for the project and to ensure that the plans are compliant with local regulations and zoning laws. I have also had to work with other professionals/consultants, such as sustaibability consultants, highway consultants, flood risk consultants and structural engineers, to ensure that the plans are practical and feasible. Through these planning applications, I have gained valuable experience in various parts of design. I am excited to continue taking on new challenges and using my skills and expertise to create innovative and successful developments for my clients.</p>
